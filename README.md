## Introduction of the Project

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in tasks such as image captioning, video understanding, and vision-language dialogue, benefiting from unified semantic representations across modalities. Despite this progress, short video platforms present distinct challenges‚Äîfrequent user interaction, code-switching, rapid scene transitions, and blended reposting patterns‚Äîthat are insufficiently addressed by current benchmarks.

To better support modeling in these dynamic scenarios, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating and improving MLLM capabilities in short video contexts, centered around three key benchmarks:

- **KwaiChat**: A multilingual, multi-topic dialogue dataset grounded in real short videos, enabling video-driven question answering, mixed-modal dialogue, and emotionally rich interactions.
- **SeriesBench**: A benchmark tailored for short video series, aimed at character consistency tracking, narrative reconstruction, and logical reasoning across clips.
- **GODBench**: A generation-oriented suite for multimodal ‚Äúgolden comment‚Äù creation, with evaluation dimensions including cultural relevance, creativity, humor, and contextual sensitivity.

The broader goal is to advance multimodal interaction from perception-level understanding to fully contextual, dialogue-centric, and creatively expressive use cases.  
Additional details, including dataset construction, evaluation protocols, and experimental results, are available on the respective pages.
